# Desktop Backup Notes - Nov 2025

This repo consists of a few planning notes, with Claude, for an updated desktop backup strategy. 

Code / execution scripts may follow for anyone interested in emulating the approach - or just installation notes.

`context.md` is my notes on what I've learned about backup so far and the type of approach I'm looking to move towards.
